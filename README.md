## Overview
This survey explores the emerging role of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** in **Model-Based Design (MBD)** for **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)**.  
It highlights how LLMs can support system modeling, code generation, verification, and maintenance within safety-critical domains such as **automotive** and **aerospace**.

## Key Points
- **MBD & CPS Background**: MBD provides a structured approach for developing complex CPS, but faces challenges in complexity, consistency, and evolving requirements.  
- **LLM Integration**:  
  - Parsing natural language requirements into models (SysML, UML, Simulink).  
  - Translating between modeling formalisms (e.g., Simulink ↔ Modelica).  
  - Supporting discrete-event and dataflow models such as **Kahn Process Networks (KPNs)**.  
  - Generating documentation, test cases, and simulation scenarios.  
- **Applications Across Lifecycle**:  
  - Requirements → Model synthesis  
  - Model understanding and refactoring  
  - Code generation and deployment support  
  - Verification, validation, and testing (VV&T)  
  - Model maintenance and evolution  
- **Domain Use Cases**:  
  - **Automotive**: Supporting ADAS/AV modeling, AUTOSAR, ISO 26262 compliance.  
  - **Aerospace**: LLM-assisted spacecraft system architecture, certification documentation.  
  - Other domains include industrial automation, smart grids, and healthcare.  
- **Challenges & Open Problems**:  
  - Ensuring correctness, reliability, and formal verification of LLM outputs.  
  - Integrating **domain-specific knowledge** and safety standards.  
  - Addressing scalability, toolchain integration, and security/privacy issues.  
  - Managing ethical and societal implications (bias, accountability, deskilling).

## Conclusion
LLMs show strong potential as **AI assistants** for engineers in MBD workflows, improving efficiency and innovation in CPS design.  
However, challenges in **verification, domain adaptation, and trustworthiness** remain.  
Future research should focus on **robust validation, domain-tuned LLMs, explainable AI, and hybrid approaches** combining symbolic and neural methods.
